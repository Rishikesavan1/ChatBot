# Phase4 - Web Integration

## Flask setup
- Ensure you have Flask installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install bash
```

# Flask application Structure
```arduino
project_directory/
├── server/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── model.py
│   ├── server.py
├── wsgi.py.py
```

## Steps to Complete Phase 4:

1. **Flask Routes:**
   - We have set up Flask routes, with the primary route at `/predict`. This route is used for handling user interactions and communication with the chatbot model.

2. **Web Interface with Next.js:**
   - Our web interface is developed using Next.js, which provides a modern and efficient user interface for interacting with the chatbot.

3. **User Authentication (NextAuth.js):**
   - User authentication is integrated into our web app using NextAuth.js. This ensures secure and personalized interactions for users.

4. **Integration with Chatbot:**
   - We have successfully integrated the chatbot functionality into the Flask route `/predict`, allowing users to interact with the chatbot through the web interface.

5. **Testing:**
   - Thorough testing of the web application, including user authentication and chatbot interactions, has been performed. We ensure that the entire system works seamlessly.

6. **Deployment:**
   - The Flask web app is deployed to our chosen hosting service. The web interface built with Next.js is hosted on a separate platform.

7. **Monitoring:**
   - We have implemented monitoring and analytics tools to track user interactions, performance, and system health.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Our project documentation is updated to reflect the integration of the chatbot into the web application. We provide clear instructions for users on how to access and interact with the chatbot.

9. **User Feedback:**
   - We actively encourage users to provide feedback on the web app's chatbot functionality, user experience, and authentication process. This feedback is invaluable for ongoing improvements.

10. **Future Enhancements:**
    - As we move forward, we consider potential enhancements, such as adding more features, refining the user interface, and expanding the chatbot's capabilities to better serve our users.

By the end of Phase 4, our chatbot is seamlessly integrated into our web application, offering an interactive and user-friendly experience. The inclusion of user authentication enhances security and personalization, making our chatbot a valuable asset to our project.
